# P/Gen
PUML Class Diagram Generator for Java

## What is P/Gen?

P/Gen is a command line interface used to generate [Plant UML](#http://plantuml.com/) class diagrams.
With a lot of options, it offers you the freedom to choose exactly which packages/classes you want to include in your diagram. 
The generated diagram will be in PUML format, which can be used by any Plant UML plugin/generator to create image files. 
P/Gen itself does not posses the ability to generate image files.

## Note

P/Gen is a fairly new project, so it is still under heavy construction.

## Usage

In the future, I will host a jar you can download. Right now, you have to clone this repository and build/run P/Gen using Gradle or your IDE.

To get a quick overview of all available parameters, use the --help program argument option.
